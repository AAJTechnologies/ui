# Nibiru UI
Nibiru UI is an abstraction layer for building generic user interfaces using a typed DSL.

The [getting started](../../wiki/Getting-Started) section explains how to start using the framework. Once you become familiar with basic concepts, you can refer to [widget reference](../../wiki/Widget-Reference) for documentation specific for each widget. If you are interested in the internal strcuture of the project and/or extending it, please read the [architecture](../../wiki/Architecture) section.
